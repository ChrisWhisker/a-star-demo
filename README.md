# A* Graph Navigation

This project implements a graph navigation algorithm that reads a graph from a text file, performs navigation using an A* search algorithm, and writes the optimal path to a solution file.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Usage

 1. Add text files aligning with the provided graph description format into the src folder (where q1.java and GraphNode.java can be found).
 2. Open command prompt in the src folder.
 3. Run command `javac q1.java` to create the .class files.
 4. Run command `java q1 <filename>` replacing <filename> with the name of a text file found in the src directory, including ".txt".
 5. A text file containing the solution will be created under src/Q1/Solutions.
